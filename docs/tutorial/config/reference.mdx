Reference for the configuration files.

## Configuration files

The configuration files are written in YAML.

They are loaded in the following order:
- from `UPSILON_CONFIG` (default: `upsilon.dev.yaml` in development builds,
`upsilon.yaml` in production builds)
- from `UPSILON_ROCKET_CONFIG` (default: `upsilon-rocket.yaml`)

## Selecting a profile

The `UPSILON_PROFILE` environment variable (default: `dev` in development
builds, `release` in production builds), can be used to select which of those
configuration files to use.

If the `UPSILON_PROFILE` environment variable is set to `dev`, the configuration
file that will be used is `upsilon.dev.yaml`, unless the `UPSILON_CONFIG`
environment variable is also set, in which case that configuration will be
used instead.

If it is set to `release`, the configuration file that will be used is
`upsilon.yaml`, unless the `UPSILON_CONFIG` environment variable is also
set, in which case that configuration will be used instead.

## Configuration file reference

Files from `UPSILON_CONFIG`, (`upsilon.dev.yaml` or `upsilon.yaml` by default)
should have the structure given by the JSON schema available here:
