In terms of the API itself, there are multiple components.

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API contains the main API for the webserver. It is implemented in
the <CrateSourceLink kind="crates" crate="upsilon-api"/> crate.

## Git over HTTP(s)

For the webserver to work with git clients over `http://`, it should invoke the
`git-http-backend` CGI backend, which is provided by `git` itself, on a few
certain paths.

The mechanism for passing the request to `git-http-backend` is implemented in
the <CrateSourceLink kind="crates" crate="upsilon-web"/> and <CrateSourceLink
kind="crates" crate="upsilon-vcs"/> crates.

## Git over SSH

The webserver also contains a small handwritten ssh server, which can be
used to serve git repositories over ssh (see <CrateSourceLink
kind="crates" crate="upsilon-ssh-russh"/>).

## Git over the `git://` protocol

The webserver can also be configured to serve git repositories over the
`git://` protocol, but as it lacks authentication, it is disabled for
private repositories. The logic to spawn the `git-daemon` process to
handle traffic over the `git://` protocol is in the <CrateSourceLink kind="crates"
crate="upsilon-vcs"/> crate.
