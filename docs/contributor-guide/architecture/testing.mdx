All integration tests go in <CrateSourceLink kind="dev"
crate="upsilon-testsuite"/>, with <CrateSourceLink kind="dev"
crate="upsilon-test-support"/> providing some
utilities for them.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you can use the `test` xtask:

```bash
cargo xtask test
# Or for short
cargo xt
```

## Writing tests

Integration tests are annotated with `#[upsilon_test]`, which handles most of
the setup, and provides a `TestCx` to the test, which is used to interact with
the webserver.

## `#[git_daemon]`

By default, the test server doesn't spawn a `git daemon`, but can be configured
to do so by annotating the `TestCx` parameter with
`#[cfg_setup(upsilon_basic_config_with_git_daemon)]`, or (recommended:)
by annotating the whole test function with `#[git_daemon]`.

## `#[git_ssh]`

Similarly, for using git over the `ssh://` protocol, you can use
`#[cfg_setup(upsilon_basic_config_with_ssh)]` or the (recommended) test
attribute `#[git_ssh]`.

Note that this does not work on windows, as `git-shell` is not available in
`git-for-windows`, so `#[git_ssh]` also implies
`#[test_attr(cfg_attr(windows, ignore))]`.

## `#[offline]`

This is an attribute that indicates that the test can work offline. It can
receive an optional argument, to control this behavior.

```rust
#[upsilon_test] // will run in offline mode (default)
async fn t1(cx: &mut TestCx) -> TestResult {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}

#[upsilon_test]
#[offline] // will run in offline mode (explicit)
async fn t2(cx: &mut TestCx) -> TestResult {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}

#[upsilon_test]
#[offline(run)] // will run in offline mode (explicit)
async fn t3(cx: &mut TestCx) -> TestResult {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}

#[upsilon_test]
#[offline(ignore)] // will not run in offline mode (ignored)
async fn t4(cx: &mut TestCx) -> TestResult {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
```

Tests that actually require to connect to some other server (over an internet
connection) should use `#[offline(ignore)]` to make sure they are online when
running.

## `#[test_attr(...)]`

`test_attr` is an attribute that can be used to annotate the actual test
function. In practice, it can be used to ignore tests on certain platforms, if
something the test requires is not available or not working properly on said
platforms, or to ignore tests that require a network connection when running in
offline mode, although those specific cases are already handled by other
attributes (see `#[git_ssh]`, `#[offline]`).

At the very end, `#[upsilon_test]` will also make sure to clean up the web
server and terminate any subprocesses it has spawned.

All tests return a `TestResult<()>`, which is just
a `Result<(), anyhow::Error>`. For the cleanup to work, tests should
return `Err` if they fail, rather than `panic!`.

## `cargo xtask test-quick`

Use a quick test setup, powered by `cargo-difftests`, to run only the tests
that are likely to have been affected by changes to the source code since
the test was last run, and ignore the others.

## Cleanup: internals

The webserver is spawned in a separate process, under a
`upsilon-gracefully-shutdown-host` process that acts as a middle-man, and
listens via `ctrlc` to signals, or to the creation of a temporary file.

### Windows

The `upsilon-gracefully-shutdown-host` process is created with
the `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` flag. When it receives an event
(via `ctrlc`), or the temporary file is created, it generates a
`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` for itself, which is then propagated to all the child
processes, thus shutting everything down.

### Linux

The `upsilon-gracefully-shutdown-host` process just waits for `SIGTERM`,
`SIGINT` or similar signals via `ctrlc`, then walks the `procfs` to find all the
descendants of the process, and sends `SIGTERM` to each of them.

### Other platforms

`procfs` is only available on Linux, so separate implementations are needed for
other platforms. The `upsilon-gracefully-shutdown-host` binary just fails to
compile on other platforms right now, making it impossible to run tests on them.
