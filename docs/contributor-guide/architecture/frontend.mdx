The frontend is written with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), and built
using the static adapter, so that it can be served by the backend.

The frontend package is located in <RepoLink
path="client" kind="tree"><code>/client</code></RepoLink>.

It uses [the houdini graphql client](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/) to
generate types and queries from the schema.

## Server-side

The frontend is built to be an SPA, so we have to serve the frontend
statically, and then use the backend to serve the API.

The code responsible for serving the frontend files lies in the <CrateSourceLink
kind="crates" crate="upsilon-web-interface"/> crate.
