There are some more complex dependencies between the building and running steps
that cargo doesn't know about.

Running the project requires the build of the following artifacts:

- `upsilon-git-protocol-accesshook`
- `upsilon-git-hooks`
- `upsilon-web`
- `upsilon`

As such, there's a custom wrapper that takes care of invoking cargo properly to
build everything we need from the workspace in the right order, following the
[cargo xtask workflows example](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask).

The source code for all the xtasks is present in the <CrateSourceLink
kind="dev" crate="upsilon-xtask"/> crate, but it has expanded to a lot more
than just building and running the project.

See [xtask @ dev-crates](../dev-crates/upsilon-xtask) for
more information.
