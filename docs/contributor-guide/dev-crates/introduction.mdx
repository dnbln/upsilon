Aside from very few exceptions, all the code in the `crates` subtree is meant
specifically for production. The `dev` subtree is meant for code that is
only to be used in development, and is not meant to be used in production.

As such, crates from `crates` subtree will not know about crates
from the `dev` subtree. However, there are exceptions.

## Exceptions

### `upsilon-web` knows about `upsilon-debug-data-driver`

In the presence of the `debug.data: true` configuration option, the
`upsilon-web` crate will use the `upsilon-debug-data-driver` binary to
generate some debug data right after launch.

### `upsilon-web` and `upsilon-api` know about `upsilon-shell`

This is a bit special, as everything they know are the options that
`upsilon-shell` accepts on the command line. This is to be able to
reconfigure the shell with the same options as the web server, allowing it
to use all the features of the web server.

See [`upsilon-shell`](./upsilon-shell) for more information.
