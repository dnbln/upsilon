Aside from very few exceptions, all the code in the `crates` subtree is meant
specifically for production. The `dev` subtree is meant for code that is
only to be used in development, and is not meant to be used in production.

As such, crates from `crates` subtree will not know about crates
from the `dev` subtree. However, there are exceptions.

## Exceptions

### `upsilon-static-plugins` depends on some `dev` crates

This allows the use of `dev` crates as plugins, and `upsilon-static-plugins`
is the only crate that is allowed to do this.

### `upsilon-web` and `upsilon-api` know about `upsilon-shell`

This is a bit special, as everything they know are the options that
`upsilon-shell` accepts on the command line. This is to be able to
reconfigure the shell with the same options as the web server, allowing it
to use all the features of the web server.

See [`upsilon-shell`](./upsilon-shell) for more information.
