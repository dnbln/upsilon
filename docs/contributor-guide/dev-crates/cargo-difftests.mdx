<>{Difftests}, {DifftestsCore} and {DifftestsTestclient}.</>

## `cargo-difftests-core`

<>Source: {DifftestsCore}.</>

Some common types and declarations used by both `cargo-difftests` and
`cargo-difftests-testclient`.

## `cargo-difftests-testclient`

<>Source: {DifftestsTestclient}.</>

A small library that initializes a directory for every test with
some information about the test, along with setting up the process to use it
as the output for the profiling files, to be able to check and rerun it
later if necessary.

## `cargo-difftests`

<>Source: {Difftests}.</>

The analyzer program. It is a cargo plugin that will print out verdicts for
all the difftests that it discovers (from the directories passed to
`cargo-difftests-testclient`), and the caller can then use that to decide
which tests need to be rerun.

For more information on how to use this, run `cargo difftests --help`.

This plugin is invoked by `cargo xtask` during the `test-quick` xtask to
decide which integration tests need to be rerun.
