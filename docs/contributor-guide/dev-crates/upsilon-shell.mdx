<CrateSourceLink crate="upsilon-shell" kind="dev"/> is a small shell-like
program that can be used to automate tasks.

To run it:

```bash
cargo run -p upsilon-shell -- --hostname localhost --http-port 8000 --https
```

The `--https` flag is optional, and it will make the shell use HTTPS instead of
HTTP.

When running the debug version of the backend, the shell will ask the server
for its configuration via the `ushCliArgs` graphql query, which are later used
to reinitialize the shell with the correct configuration.

In release mode, the shell will do the same thing, but the backend will reply
with a non-existent arg, forcing the shell to exit. This can be overridden with
the `--no-reconfigure` flag, which will make the shell only use the flags that
were passed on the command line.
